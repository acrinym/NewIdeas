' MidiToQms.bas - simple outline for converting MIDI to QMS
' This is only a stub and does not implement full MIDI parsing.

INPUT "MIDI file to convert: ", midi$
INPUT "Output QMS file: ", qms$

' QB64 does not have built-in MIDI reading, so you would need
' to parse the binary file manually or call an external tool.
' The following is only a placeholder demonstrating file access.

IF _FILEEXISTS(midi$) THEN
    OPEN midi$ FOR BINARY AS #1
    ' read header bytes, map events to PLAY notes
    ' ... complex parsing not implemented
    CLOSE #1
    OPEN qms$ FOR OUTPUT AS #2
    PRINT #2, "T120 O4 CDEF" ' placeholder
    CLOSE #2
    PRINT "Converted"; midi$; "to"; qms$
ELSE
    PRINT "File not found"; midi$
END IF
