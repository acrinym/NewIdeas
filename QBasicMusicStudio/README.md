# QBasic Music Studio

QBasic Music Studio is a small example application written for QB64 Phoenix Edition. It demonstrates how to compose simple melodies using the `PLAY`, `SOUND`, and `BEEP` commands while supporting basic mouse interaction.

Features include:

- Mouse driven interface for entering notes.
- Right-click any note to edit its pitch, octave and duration.
- Press **N** to select what note or rest will be placed on a click.
- Press **T** to change the current time signature.
- Saving compositions to `.qms` files.
- Loading and editing previously saved files.
- Reference sheet with octave/frequency chart.
- Experimental MIDI to QMS converter stub.

This directory only contains a minimal implementation intended as a starting point. See `QMusicStudio.bas` for the main program.
