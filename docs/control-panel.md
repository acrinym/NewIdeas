# Cycloside Control Panel

The Control Panel provides a single place to tweak common Cycloside options.
It is accessible from the tray icon via **Settings → Control Panel…** or from
the main window's **Settings** menu.

## Features

- Toggle **Launch at Startup** and set the path to the `dotnet` executable.
- Open the plugin manager, theme settings and skin editor windows.
- Access runtime settings for plugin isolation and crash logging.
- Enable Safe Mode per built-in plugin when needed.

Changes are saved back to `settings.json` when you press **Save**.

Note: Managed Visual Host options (native colors, preset theme, sensitivity, and per‑visualizer settings)
are available directly in the visualizer window and persist automatically; they do not appear in the Control Panel.
