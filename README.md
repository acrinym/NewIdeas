## Installing In-Browser AHK Script
1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension.
2. Open `In-Browser AHK (AutoHotkey-like Features)-0.2.6.user.js` in your browser.
3. Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script. Confirm the installation.
4. After installation, click the Tampermonkey icon and you should see "In-Browser AHK Settings" in the menu.
5. Use this menu to configure hotkeys or open the settings panel.
6. You can now export or import configurations as JSON or `.bahk` files from the settings panel and reset everything to defaults if needed.
