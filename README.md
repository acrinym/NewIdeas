## Multi-Project Architecture

Cycloside now uses a modular multi-project structure:

```
CyclosideNextFeatures/
├── Core/           # EventBus, JSON config, message system
├── Bridge/         # Serial/MQTT/OSC communication protocols
├── Input/          # MIDI & Gamepad input routing
├── SSH/            # SSH client management with profiles
├── Rules/          # Event-driven automation engine
├── Utils/          # Windows utilities (screenshot, notes, etc.)
├── SampleHost/     # Console demo wiring everything together
└── Cycloside/      # Main Avalonia UI application
```

Each project can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while communicating through the shared EventBus system.

## Customising

1.  **Right‑click the tray icon** to access **Settings**.
2.  Open **Skin/Theme Editor** to modify `.axaml` theme files or cursor choices.
3.  Toggle window effects or enable/disable plugins as desired.
4.  Themes and plugin settings are stored in `settings.json` next to the executable.
    Use the provided `Blank.axaml` theme and skin as starting points in
    `Cycloside/Themes/Global/` and `Cycloside/Skins/`.

Detailed instructions for creating your own look are in
[`docs/theming-skinning.md`](docs/theming-skinning.md).

For plugin development details see [`docs/plugin-dev.md`](docs/plugin-dev.md).
For details on the new fully managed visualization system (no native deps), see
[`docs/managed-visuals.md`](docs/managed-visuals.md).
Examples live under [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples/).
For volatile scripting see [`docs/volatile-scripting.md`](docs/volatile-scripting.md).
