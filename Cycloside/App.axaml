      REFACTOR: This is the central resource dictionary for the application.
      It's empty by default.
      Your 'ThemeManager' or 'SkinManager' (in C#) will be responsible for loading 
      the selected skin file (e.g., Mint.axaml) and merging its resources here at runtime.
      This allows resources like 'ApplicationBackgroundBrush' to be found by any window.
